This doc briefly explains all the main files needed to run Vconv-DAE:

--train_vol_autoencoder.lua is the main file that trains the auto-encoder on volumetric data.
--The Data is stored in the Data folder.


-- FT_trained_model.lua fine tunes the trained model for the task of classification.

--tes_overall_error.lua takes the test set for each class and outputs the shape completion and
denoising error.

--interpolating decoder.lua is used to write the encoder and deccoder into binary file for the blending purpose.
--the output of this script is later fed to a mat script (view_interpolation.m) that does the blending and visualize it.
