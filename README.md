# VCONV-DAE: Deep Volumetric Shape learning without object labels
Code for reproducing experiments in https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49409-8_20

VCONV-DAE is a 3D volumetric denoising auto-encoder. This repository provides the data as well as code-tools
used to train the model and visualize the end results for shape completion and interpolation. 

# Prerequisites 
This repository has a mix of scripts written in lua and Matlab. Torch needs to be installed to train the model. For visualization purpose, Matlab is required. Note that this code is written for research purpose only. Please make use of Readme files to make best use of scripts avilable here.
